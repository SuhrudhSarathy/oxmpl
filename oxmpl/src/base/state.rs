/// This enum is the counterpart to `StateSpaceVariant` and is the core of the "enum dispatch"
/// pattern. It allows a `CompoundState` to hold a heterogeneous collection of different concrete
/// state types in a type-safe way.
///
/// The `Custom` variant provides an "escape hatch" for users to include their own `State`
/// implementations.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use oxmpl::base::state::{CompoundState, RealVectorState, SO2State, StateVariant};
///
/// let pos_variant = StateVariant::RealVector(RealVectorState::new(vec![1.0, 2.0]));
/// let rot_variant = StateVariant::SO2(SO2State::new(std::f64::consts::PI));
///
/// let combined_state = CompoundState {
///     components: vec![pos_variant, rot_variant],
